This repository is created for Beginners to walkthrough the Core Basics and move on with a fast pace.
After learning these, you will be internship ready.

This Repository is based on the work of [codebasics](https://github.com/codebasics/py)
I have made my contributions to update the code with updated syntax, flashcards to learn concepts faster and long-term, and cheatsheets for you as a gift.

Welcome to the world of AI!
